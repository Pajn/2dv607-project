## Redux Example

A very small minimalistic example, hopefully easy to understand. Implements React Router and uses components inside components to create a basic layout(I call it "wrap-component").

Comes with a node server, this is optional to use. Simply allows one to browse from "http://localhost:3000" in case no server is available. This example however works without a server by simply opening the index.html.

It does NOT use middleware for asynchronus actions.
